It's from:

https://github.com/YaserMarey/101-ng-tnt-source

I modify this repository of author. I make a simpler version on my github.

Please use `http-server` to run this directory.

Install: `npm install http-server -g`

Run: `http-server /path/to/awesome-angularjs-examples/101-ng-tnt-source`

Otherwise, you will can't watch `directive` function. Refer issue: `http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27742070/angularjs-error-cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-protocol-schemes`
